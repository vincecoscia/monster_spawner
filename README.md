## Compiling the mod
Installing stable releases from Nexus Mods is recommended for most users. If you really want to
compile the mod yourself, read on.

These mods use the [crossplatform build config](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
so they can be built on Linux, Mac, and Windows without changes. See [the build config documentation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
for troubleshooting.


### Compiling the mod for testing
To compile a mod and add it to your game's `Mods` directory:

1. Rebuild the project using [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/).  
   <small>This will compile the code and package it into the mod directory.</small>
2. Launch the project with debugging.  
   <small>This will start the game through SMAPI and attach the Visual Studio debugger.</small>
